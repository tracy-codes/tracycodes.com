Hello and welcome to my brand new blog! I'm thrilled to have you here and excited to share my journey and insights with you. For those who know me, you're probably aware that writing has been a side passion of mine. However, since starting my current role at GenesysGo, where I've been immersed in the fascinating world of decentralized storage and compute, my writing took a bit of a backseat.

At GenesysGo, I've been tackling some incredibly interesting challenges, delving deep into the intricacies of decentralized technologies. This experience has been nothing short of exhilarating. Yet, amidst the hustle and bustle, I felt a void, something I couldn't quite put my finger on at first. It took me a while, but I realized that it was writing – my creative outlet – that I was missing. So, here I am, reigniting my passion for writing and sharing my experiences and knowledge with you.

In this blog, I plan to cover a range of topics, primarily focusing on technical discussions around Rustlang. Expect articles ranging from intermediate to advanced topics, designed to provide deep insights and practical knowledge for those interested in this powerful language.

But that's not all. As a developer working with Solana, I'll also be sharing my experiences and learnings in Solana development. This will include everything from basic tutorials to advanced discussions, aimed at helping you navigate through the complexities of blockchain development.

The world of distributed systems has always fascinated me, and I'll be sharing my thoughts and discoveries in this area as well. From theoretical concepts to real-world applications, I aim to explore the vast landscape of distributed computing and its implications in today's tech-driven world.

Alongside these technical discourses, I may share personal life updates, giving you a glimpse into the life of a nerd juggling professional challenges and personal growth.

I'm also open to your suggestions and requests. If there's a specific topic related to Rustlang, Solana development, distributed systems, or anything else you'd like me to explore, please don't hesitate to send me a direct message on Twitter at [@tracy_codes](https://twitter.com/tracy_codes). Your input is invaluable, and I look forward to engaging with you and growing together in this journey.

Thank you for joining me here. Let's embark on this exciting adventure together, exploring the depths of technology and its endless possibilities.
